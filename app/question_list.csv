frequency	frequency	3	How many <i>word-final</i> periods are in the following paragraph: "There are other relationship types besides the one-to-many. The one-to-one relationship can be expressed as the one-to-many described earlier, but with the uselist option set to False within the db.relationship() definition so that the "many" side becomes a "one" side. The many-to-one relationship can also be expressed as a one-to-many if the tables are reversed, or it can be expressed with the foreign key and the db.relationship() definition both on the "many" side. The most complex relationship type, the many-to-many, requires an additional table called an association table. You will learn about many-to-many relationships in Chapter 12."	1	fitb
