<h2> The {{title}} tool: What is it? </h2>

<p>This is the foundation of all computational linguistics. In nearly all applications, certain features are identified, and the number of times these features occur is logged.  The <b>distribution</b> of these features, that is, the frequencies of the different features, is used to identify certain characteristics about a document, a sample of text, and even speech sounds.</p>

<p>If you recall from the discussion on Sentiment Analysis, frequency was used to help determine the sentiment of movie reviews, that is, whether or not a movie review was positive, negative, or neutral.  Generally speaking, the more frequent positive words were, the more likely a review was to be positive, and vice versa.  There is another kind of feature that is sort of the opposite of frequency.  It looks at <b>distict</b> units, which just cares whether a feature is present or not.  For example, out of the following words "good, bad, good", there are 2 distinct words - "good" and "bad" - it doesn't care how frequent either of them are.  This would not be a good method to classify movie reviews.  If, for example, there were 20 positive words and 1 negative word in a movie review, this method would note that there was at least one positive word, and at least one negative word.  It doesn't care how <i>frequent</i> either of them are, just whether or not they exist.  There are certainly situations in which this sort of non-frequency feature is helpful, but it do not occur terribly often, and we will not be using it today.  Nonetheless, it is important to know that it exists.</p>

<h2> Understanding the {{title}} feature and how it's used. </h2>

<p>Frequency is used to provide counts for other features.  In the Sentiment Analysis activity, it was used to count the number of words falling into specific groups (positve vs. negative).  There are multitudes of other applications, however (lots of things to count!).  A few include: </p>

<li>Characters
<li>Punctuation
<li>Sets of characters or words
<li>Specific words

<p>These merit some explanation.  What do I mean by <i>characters</i>?  Characters in computational linguistics refers to a letter, number or symbol.  Basically a single unit that you can type.  Why are these important?  Well, in short you can tell a lot from the kind of characters and the amount of characters that are used.  For example, you might be able to differentiate two authors by counting the number of characters in each word they write, and taking the average of it.  A person who is 20 will likely write words that are generally longer than a child who is 6.</p>

<!-- <h3></h3> -->
<p>Punctuation is a specific type of character.  The <i>frequency</i> of punctuation can also differentiate two authors.  It might be possible that one person is very keen on using exact and proper punctuation.  It is just as likely (if not moreso) that there is someone who is not.  This person may forget to place apostrophes in places when needed, or might put commas in places they aren't.</p>

What is the <i>average</i> number of punctuation marks <i>per sentence</i>? (Use a calculator if you need, and remember the equation for calculating an average: total number (of punctuation), divided by the number of groups (number of sentences)):<br>
"Serve your customers fresh coffee with this single serving stainless steel Vietnamese style coffee press! This coffee press includes a built-in filter so you can brew to the ideal strength, tightening the press for a stronger beverage, and loosening it to take the edge off. Its convenient design fits in the top rim of mugs or cups to deliver a single serving of your most popular coffee or tea. For versatility, this coffee press can be used with hot coffee, Vietnamese iced coffee, loose leaf tea, and more. And thanks to its stainless steel structure, you can be sure this coffee press can stand up to the rigors of day-to-day use."

<p>Sets of characters, words, or other useful items are called <i>N-grams</i>, and are very widely used in computational linguistics; however there is a specific module (the next one) dedicated to discussing these, and so they won't be covered in more depth here.  Specific words (<i><b>uni</b>-grams</i>, meaning <b>one</b> unit) can also be indicative of different authors.  Yet there are certain words which are more helpful than others.  Think of a situation in which one person is writing an article about golf, and then the same person is writing an different article about Tucson restaurants.  The same author wrote both articles, but there will be a lot of words about golf in one, and a lot of words about food in the other.  These words, called <i>content words</i> (they carry most of the information), will not be very helpful to match the two articles to the same author, because they are different.  However, other words, such as <i>the, in, with,</i> etc, will very likely be used in both articles.  These kind of words (called <i>function words</i>) are used by everybody in anything that is written, but often used differently, and in different <i>frequencies</i> from different people.  This makes them ideal for using as features.  Function words and content words will be discussed further in the module covering <i>Parts of Speech</i>.</p>

<p>There are many other applications of frequency, some of which you will be able to observe when chosing features for authorship detection to solve the murder mystery.  As you've probably guessed, frequency is always used in conjunction with other features, because it is a method of measuring.  Frequency by itself is not a feature, but a way of determining the ability of a feature to be useful.  In authorship detection, for example, if a feature is equally frequent in two texts from two authors, it is not useful in telling the two authors apart.  However, if this feature is frequently used by one author, and rarely used by another, it has a great deal of usefulness.</p>

<p>Now you have the first bit of understanding you will need to begin your investigation.  By completing and passing the quiz below, you'll unlock the first set of features you will need to begin testing out your authorship detection program!</p>
