<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>By now you ought to have read through the case <a href=""><i>Picture Imperfect</i></a>, which is already a solved murder mystery.  We will be using the documents from this murder mystery to <i>train</i> our Authorship Detection System.  What this means, is that will will configure our system to the point where we know that it can correctly identify the author of a document.  At that point, we can apply the system that we have to our unsolved murder mystery documents, and correctly identify the author of the suicide note - the murderer.</p>

<p>Well how does one <i>configure</i> the Authorship Detection System?  While there are some advanced techniques, we'll be focusing on the foundation and most critical part of the system - the features.  What are the features?  They tell the system the things to look for in the document, the characteristics about the author's writing to look at when determining authorship.<p/>

<p>You've already learned a little about features and how <i>frequency</i> is used as a measuring tool when investigating these features.  Now that you know about frequency, use the following strings as your features!</p>

<li>"AWL" (average word length)</li>
<li>"ASL" (average sentence length)</li>
<li>"PF" (punctuation frequency)</li>
<li>"FPF" (final punctuation frequency)</li>
<li>"CF" (contraction frequency)</li>
